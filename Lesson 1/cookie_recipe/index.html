<h2>SKILL LEVEL</h2>
<p>	Easy

<h2>	YIELD<h2>
	<p>2 dozen 3-inch cookies

<h2>	INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
	<li>	2 cups minus 2 tablespoons cake flour
	<li>	1 2/3 cups bread flour
	<li>	1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
		<li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
	<li>	1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt
	<li>	2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter
	<li>	1 1/4 cups light brown sugar
	<li>	1 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
	<li>	2 large eggs
	<li>	2 teaspoons natural vanilla extract
		<li>1 cup dark chocolate chips
		<li>1 cup milk chocolate chips
		<li>1 teaspoon sea salt
</ul>

<h2>	INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
<ol>
<li>		Sift cake flour, bread flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl. Set aside.

	<li>	Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl until very light, about 5 minutes.

	<li>	Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.

<li>		Beat in the vanilla.

<li>		Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients and mix until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds.

<li>		Drop chocolate chips in and incorporate them without breaking them.

<li>		Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours. Dough may be used in batches, and can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours.

<li>		When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and scoop 1/3 cup mounds of dough (the size of golf balls) onto baking sheet, making sure to turn horizontally any chocolate pieces that are poking up for a more attractive cookie.

<li>		Sprinkle lightly with sea salt and bake until golden brown but still soft, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer immediately to a wire rack.

<li>		Repeat with remaining dough, or reserve dough, refrigerated, for baking remaining batches the next day.

<li>		Eat warm, with a glass of milk.
</ol>

	EXPERT TIPS</h2>
<p>
	The secret to richer Chocolate Chip Cookies with a more sophisticated flavor is letting the dough rest for 24 to 36 hours before baking.
